 A. High-level modules should not depend upon low-level modules. Both should depend upon abstractions.
 B. Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.

 DIP is very similar to Open-Closed Principle: the approach to use, to have a clean architecture, is decoupling the dependencies. You can achieve it thanks to abstract layers.
